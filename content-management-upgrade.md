## What We Accomplished

- ✅ Created content directory structure
- ✅ Implemented Markdown processing
- ✅ Built automated update scripts
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Tested the complete workflow

## Technical Implementation

The new system uses:

- **Remark**: For processing Markdown content
- **Automated Scripts**: For building and deployment

## Benefits for Content Creators

- Simple Markdown formatting
- Automated build process
- Safe content updates
- Quick publishing workflow

## Next Steps
