# Core Gameplay Systems

We're currently focused on building the foundational systems that will power the Civitas experience. This includes:

## Decision Trees
Creating branching narrative paths that reflect the complexity of political decision-making. Each choice will have meaningful consequences that ripple through the game world.

## Political Mechanics
Implementing systems for governance, policy-making, and political maneuvering that are both realistic and engaging.

## Progress Update
- ‚úÖ Basic decision framework completed
- üîÑ Policy implementation system in development
- ‚è≥ Consequence modeling in planning phase

The core systems are taking shape and we're excited about the depth and complexity we're achieving while maintaining accessibility for players.
