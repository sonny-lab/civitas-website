# User Interface Design

Our UI design philosophy centers on creating an interface that feels both historically authentic and modern in its usability.

## Design Principles
- **Medieval Aesthetic**: Incorporating design elements that evoke the historical period
- **Modern Usability**: Ensuring the interface is intuitive for contemporary users
- **Accessibility**: Making the game accessible to players with different needs and abilities

## Current Focus
We're working on wireframes and prototypes that balance the rich visual style with clear, functional design. The challenge is creating something that feels immersive without sacrificing usability.

## Next Steps
- Complete initial wireframe designs
- Create interactive prototypes
- Conduct user testing sessions
- Iterate based on feedback
