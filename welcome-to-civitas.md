# Welcome to Civitas

Civitas is more than just a game - it's an immersive experience that teaches players about political strategy, governance, and decision-making in a fun and engaging way.

Our vision is to create a simulation that bridges the gap between entertainment and education, allowing players to explore the complexities of political leadership while having fun. Whether you're interested in learning about political systems, testing your strategic thinking, or simply enjoying a unique gaming experience, Civitas offers something for everyone.

The name "Civitas" comes from the Latin word meaning "citizenship" or "community of citizens," perfectly capturing our game's focus on civic engagement and political understanding.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop this exciting project!
